It’s leg day in the sky!
Mash those glutes into orbit by tapping your phone like crazy!
The harder you tap, the higher you jump.
You’ve only got one shot to reach peak altitude — so give it everything you’ve got!

First one to the stratosphere (or just the highest cloud) wins eternal glory...
...and really sore thumbs.
