Don’t be the last one holding it...
It’s a ticking time bomb — literally!
Pass the hot potato before it explodes in your hands!
You never know when it will blow — anywhere between 20 and 30 seconds!
Hold it too long, and BOOM ... you’re out.

Fast reflexes and sneaky timing will keep you in the game.
Will you pass it in time, or will the potato roast you?
