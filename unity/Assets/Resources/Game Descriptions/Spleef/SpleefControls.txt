How to play:
Move using the on-screen joystick.
Tap the A button to jump over gaps. 
Tap A again while airborne to dive forward.
Hold the C button to sprint — but watch your stamina bar!
Running makes tiles fall faster beneath you… so use your moves wisely!

Stay sharp, stay moving — and don’t fall into the lava!
