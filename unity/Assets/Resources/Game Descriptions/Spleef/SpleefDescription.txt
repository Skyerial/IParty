Watch your step... or fall into the lava!
Run around the arena, but be careful — every tile you step on falls away, leaving a trail behind you!
Stay on solid ground while dodging holes, opponents and your own footsteps.
Tiles respawn after a while, but don’t count on them being there when you need them!

Below you: lava.
Around you: chaos.
Last player standing wins!
