# Minigames
A quick description for all the minigames.

### Whack a Mole
They pop up... you slam down!
In this chaotic reflex-fest, your goal is simple: WHACK the moles before they disappear.
But beware!

    Moles = +1 point

    Bombs = -1 point

    Oil Barrels = screen SPLAT!

React fast, aim true and don’t get blinded by the mess.
Can you out whack your rivals and become the mole-slaying champ?


### Tanks
Lock on. Line up. Fire!
Battle it out in a chaotic tank arena where every shot counts.
Aim at your opponents and blast them into bits — but don’t get trigger-happy...
Your bullets have to reload, so no spamming allowed!

Move smart, shoot sharp, and stay alive.
The last tank standing wins the war!


### Spleef
Watch your step... or fall into the lava!
Run around the arena, but be careful — every tile you step on falls away, leaving a trail behind you!
Stay on solid ground while dodging holes, opponents and your own footsteps.
Tiles respawn after a while, but don’t count on them being there when you need them!

Below you: lava.
Around you: chaos.
Last player standing wins!


### Turf
Paint the world — and win the turf!
Grab your paint blaster and cover the field in your color!
The more ground you paint, the closer you get to victory.
But watch out — your paint magazine empties fast!
You’ll need to wait a few seconds to reload, so time your moves carefully.

Paint smart.
Move fast.
The player with the most turf painted wins the match!


### Speedtyper
Race across the river by typing as fast as you can!
Words appear on your screen — type each one correctly to walk on a bridge and cross to the other side.
The faster you type, the quicker you move! But watch out: typos will slow you down!


### Set
Eyes sharp, brain sharper!
In this lightning-fast pattern-matching challenge, you’ll scan a grid of colorful cards and race to find sets — groups of three cards that are all the same or all different in every way.

Shape, color, number, and fill — they all matter.
See a set? Tap it fast before someone else does!

The player with the most sets when time’s up wins the match!
Ready, set... SET!


### Skyglutes
It’s leg day in the sky!
Mash those glutes into orbit by tapping your phone like crazy!
The harder you tap, the higher you jump.
You’ve only got one shot to reach peak altitude — so give it everything you’ve got!

First one to the stratosphere (or just the highest cloud) wins eternal glory...
...and really sore thumbs.


### Hot Potato
Don’t be the last one holding it...
It’s a ticking time bomb — literally!
Pass the hot potato before it explodes in your hands!
You never know when it will blow — anywhere between 20 and 30 seconds!
Hold it too long, and BOOM ... you’re out.

Fast reflexes and sneaky timing will keep you in the game.
Will you pass it in time, or will the potato roast you?
