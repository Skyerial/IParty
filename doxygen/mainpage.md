# iParty

### Overview
**iParty** is a Unity-based digital party game where players use their mobile phones as controllers. Compete in fast-paced and chaotic minigames to gain the upper hand, move higher on the board, and ultimately win it all! This project was developed for the *Project Software Engineering* course at the **University of Amsterdam**.

### Features
- Multiplayer gameplay using mobile devices as controllers
- A virtual board that players progress through
- A variety of minigames designed to test different skills

### Getting Started in the Editor
1. Open the Unity project located in `unity/` using Unity Hub or the Unity Editor.
2. Move to the MainMenu scene and hit play.
3. Connect 2-4 phones, choose your names and enjoy the game!

In game scripts are organised by minigames that they belong to, with seperate folders that manage the server and for more general functionalities. This page documents the C# scripts that run the game and the Javascript files used to supply the phones with controllers and to receive the inputs.

### Build the game as an Executable
- Enter the "Build Profiles" within the Unity Editor via File -> Build Profiles or simply press CTRL + SHIFT + B.
- Select the correct build profile, and press the build button to build an executeable.(Make sure that all the scenes are selected and present and the MainMenu scene is at index 0!)
- If all goes well, the selected folder should now contain all the necessary files and the executeable.
