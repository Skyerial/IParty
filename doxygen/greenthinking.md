# Green Thinking

In taking the Project Software Engineering course we were instructed to be mindful of the environmental impact of our project when making decisions.

Lönnqvist (2022) wrote one of the most extensive reviews of the environmental impact of the gaming industry as a whole. To us, the first things we though of for green thinking was our own performance, but this paper identifies controller lifetimes and game distribution as easier avenues of improvements. We also looked at the environmental impact of using Unity, though research appears to be quite scarce. Pérez at al. compared the performance of Unity and Unreal Engine was more efficient for physics and static meshes. Our game design decisions circumvent the need to sell any seperate controllers, as everyone can be assume to own a smartphone. Additionally, we avoided the use of dynamic meshes.

We chose a low-poly style for the game, reducing the processing cost of graphics and physics. we also limit the frames to 30fps in lobbies and 60fps on the gameboard.
